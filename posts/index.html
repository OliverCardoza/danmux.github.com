			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Like Basil Fawlty, Bazel promises a great deal, but makes a bit of a fuss about something that could have been done so much more easily. This is at least true in any medium to large sized Golang project, it is worse if using OSX. Whilst Bazels goals are desireable they are easily and more simply achieved with the Go tools, especially since go 1.10.

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>We are all products of our own histories, and I suspect many routes to Go have been made less enjoyable by misguided expectations. The journey from when a budding developer first ‘hello worlded’ to now may have made Go’s more subtle strengths less obvious to them.

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Coming from a background where memory and clock cycles were sparse, binary encodings have always held an appeal. Since then I’ve been told we have loads of compute power, ample cheap RAM and disk, and when the network is the bottleneck then, well, that is a good problem to have.
Its one of those ages old occasionally heated debates&hellip;.
