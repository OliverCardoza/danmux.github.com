      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv0onXhyLlE&#34;&gt;Basil Fawlty&lt;/a&gt;, Bazel promises a great deal, but makes a bit of a fuss about something that could have been done so much more easily. This is at least true in any medium to large sized Golang project, it is worse if using OSX. Whilst Bazels goals are desireable they are easily and more simply achieved with the Go tools, especially since go 1.10.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A favourite test helper library, with some simple test assertion functions clearly has some value. But this post puts forward some useable concrete arguments why they are normally just not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Golang Is and Is Not</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are all products of our own histories, and I suspect many routes to Go have been made less enjoyable by misguided expectations. The journey from when a budding developer first ‘hello worlded’ to now may have made Go’s more subtle strengths less obvious to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is I have mentioned in a previous post we are all products of our own histories, and this will definitely impact your appreciation or frustration of the subtleties of the Go community guidelines on naming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
